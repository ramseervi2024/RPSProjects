React Native Take-Home Assignment: Smart Hero Gallery (Alive)
Build a smart, horizontally scrollable hero gallery for an experience page. The gallery comes from an API and
contains images and videos with different aspect ratios. The component must stay smooth for large lists (100+
items).
What this tests
• React Native UI and layout skills
• Performance on long, media-heavy lists
• TypeScript discipline and clean code
• Robust media loading with fallbacks
• Practical product UX (scroll hint, loading and error states)
API
Use this endpoint as-is:

GET https://dev.iamalive.app/api/destinations/experience/learn-horse-riding-and-
trot-down-a-private-forest-trail?fields=gallery

You will use data.gallery (array) from the response. Each item includes: src (filename), type (image or video),
aspectRatio, and optional alt.
Output to build
Create a screen or component named SmartHeroGallery that:
1. Fetches the gallery from the API.
2. Builds the gallery into pages using the rules below.
3. Renders pages in a horizontal, continuous scroll.
4. Loads media using the CDN path rules and fallbacks.
5. Shows a nudge on the first page to hint there is more content.
Page layout (fixed)
The gallery is shown as pages. Each page is a fixed 2-column block:
Column 1 (left)
• One large tile (hero tile).
• Prefer a video here when possible.
Column 2 (right)
• Two tiles stacked vertically.
• Both tiles must have equal height.

• Prefer images in this column.
Video rule (updated)
Only one video is allowed per page.
• The video should preferably be in Column 1. If there are not enough images to fill both stacked tiles in
Column 2, then the video may fallback into Column 2 to keep the page complete.
Media selection rules
1) Preserve API order as much as possible
• Keep items in the same order as the API response whenever possible. Reorder only when needed to satisfy
the video preference or to fill the page.
2) Video preference is applied from Page 1 onwards
For each page, in order (Page 1, then Page 2, and so on):
• If videos are available in the remaining list, pick the video whose aspect ratio is closest to 9:16.
• This is done page-by-page starting from Page 1 (not one global pick for the entire gallery).
• Tie breaker: if two videos are equally close, choose the one that appears earlier in the remaining list.
9:16 ratio = 9/16 = 0.5625. Use abs(video.aspectRatio - 0.5625) and choose the smallest value.
3) Fill the page
Each page must render 3 tiles total: 1 in Column 1 and 2 in Column 2.
• Preferred fill order:
• Column 1: selected video if available, else an image.
• Column 2: two images.
• If images are not enough for Column 2, allow the selected video to be placed in Column 2 (still only one
video on the page).
Continuous scrolling
Render the pages in a horizontal list. The scroll must be continuous and smooth, even with 100+ items. Use
snap or paging so the list lands cleanly on a page.
Smart cover rule (simple)
Media should fill the tile nicely, with minimal cropping.
Aim to crop mainly on one axis (either vertical or horizontal) as much as possible, not heavily on both. Explain
your approach in the README.
CDN paths (generalised)
You receive only filenames in src. Build URLs using these constants:

CDN_BASE = "https://cdn.iamalive.app"
PROCESSED_MOBILE_PREFIX = "/processed/mobile/"
PREVIEW_PREFIX = "/processed/preview/"
Images
Processed: CDN_BASE + PROCESSED_MOBILE_PREFIX + src
Original fallback: CDN_BASE + "/" + src
Preview placeholder: CDN_BASE + PREVIEW_PREFIX + src
Videos
Video file URL:
Processed: CDN_BASE + PROCESSED_MOBILE_PREFIX + src
Original fallback: CDN_BASE + "/" + src
Video thumbnail (poster) filename = src + ".webp"
Processed thumbnail: CDN_BASE + PROCESSED_MOBILE_PREFIX + (src + ".webp")
Original thumbnail: CDN_BASE + "/" + (src + ".webp")
Preview thumbnail: CDN_BASE + PREVIEW_PREFIX + (src + ".webp")
Progressive loading and fallbacks (must do)
Images
• Show preview placeholder first (try to load it; if it fails, skip it).
• Then load processed mobile image.
• If processed fails, fallback to original.
• Do not do HEAD checks for every asset.
Videos
• Keep the video autoplay
• Always show a poster first: preview thumbnail (if it loads) -> processed thumbnail -> original thumbnail.
• While the video downloads, keep showing the poster.
• If processed video fails, fallback to original video.
• If playback fails, keep the poster and show a Tap to retry overlay.
On click of any item, it should show that image/video in full screen modal like carousel.
- User should be able to navigate to prev/next similar to carousel.
- In full screen, it should show full content without truncate unlike cover.
- on double click or pinch zoom, image should be zoomable.
- no zoom on video

Reference:

First page nudge (scroll hint)
• Show a small nudge button on the right centre edge of Page 1 only.
• On press, smoothly scroll to Page 2 (the next page).
• Hide the nudge after the first press or once the user scrolls away from Page 1.
Performance requirements
The gallery can contain 100+ items. Your solution must remain smooth.
• Use a horizontal FlatList (recommended).
• Memoise tiles/pages to reduce re-renders.
• Use stable callbacks (avoid unnecessary inline props).
• Pause or unmount video when its page is not visible.
• Avoid heavy work in render; keep page building logic outside render.
Core logic requirement (must do)
Create a deterministic pure function that builds pages:
type GalleryItem = {
_id: string;
type: "image" | "video";
src: string;
alt?: string;
aspectRatio?: number;
};
type PageLayout = {
left: GalleryItem;
rightTop: GalleryItem;
rightBottom: GalleryItem;
};
function buildPages(items: GalleryItem[], opts?: { lookahead?: number }):
PageLayout[]
Lookahead is optional but recommended (example 12). It helps preserve order while picking a good portrait
video with minimal movement.
Extra tasks (pick any 2)
Complete any 2 extras below to show full React Native expertise:
Extra 1: Prefetch
When the user is on page N, prefetch images for page N+1 (and optionally N+2). For videos, prefetch only
thumbnails (not the full video file).

Extra 2: Viewability control for video
Allow video playback only on the current visible page. Pause as soon as the page is not visible (example
threshold: 60%).
Extra 3: Unit tests for page building
Add tests for buildPages(): only images, multiple videos with different aspect ratios, missing aspect ratios, long
list behaviour.
Extra 4: Page indicator
Add a simple dots indicator that shows current page index.
Deliverables
• GitHub repo or zip.
• README with setup steps.
• Short explanation of buildPages logic and how you preserve order.
• How you handled fallbacks: preview -> processed -> original.
• What you did for performance (FlatList settings, memo, viewability, etc.).
• What you would improve with more time.
Acceptance checklist
• Fetches the API and reads data.gallery.
• Builds pages using the rules above.
• 2-column layout: left hero + 2 stacked tiles with equal height.
• Only 1 video per page.
• Video is placed in Column 1 unless images are not enough, then it may be in Column 2.
• Closest-to-9:16 video preference is applied page-by-page starting from Page 1.
• Horizontal scroll is smooth for large lists.
• Progressive loading works: preview -> processed -> original.
• Video shows poster while loading and has a retry fallback.
• First page nudge scrolls to the next page smoothly.
